# YATA (Yet Another Todo App)

## Quickstart

If you don't have `nvm` installed, install via `npm i -g nvm`. Then use `nvm use` to set the version of Node used in building and running. If you don't have the appropriate Node version, use `nvm install 16.20.0`.

Next, run `yarn install`.

Then, run `yarn run start`. You should be directed to `localhost:3000`.
